Take a look at RentCarService class

1. Refactor to object-oriented model - separate rules from the process
2. Make the integration test (RentCarServiceIntegrationTest) pass (happy path for rental process)
 - you might need to correct some bugs :)
3. Make the unit tests for the customer object model pass (CustomerTest)
 - you need to implement some new methods (and create them)
4. What happens if database/application crashes after sending an e-mail? How to prevent that? (32nd line in RentCarService class)
5. Do I want to test if the e-mail gets sent after not successful rental? (34th line in RentCarService class)
